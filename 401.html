<h3 style="color: azure; font: italic;"> 1. Repeat the MILD process even more. Repetition helps to strengthen MILD. Consistency helps too. If you want to make any changes to your dream plan, you can, but try to be as consistent in your plans as possible to really strengthen your intention.
<br>
<br>
  2. Include a mantra into MILD such as I will have a lucid dream tonight. Be sure to use mantras mindfully with true intention, rather than just going through the motions.
  <br>
  <br>
  3. Repeat the MILD process at different times throughout the day for an extra boost. You can do it in morning, day, before bed, and during any times you wake up in the night to strengthen MILD.
  <br>
  <br>
  4. Train yourself to follow through on your future plans and goals in daily life. Forming a habit of following through on your intentions regularly can greatly increase the effectiveness of MILD because this technique is based on the notion that you'll follow through on your plan to become lucid. The more you follow through on plans you set in waking life (doesn't have to be related to lucidity), the more likely you'll be to follow through with MILD. This is something you can train yourself to do more throughout the day. If you are already the kind of person who always follows through on intention anyway, this tip probably won't help youâ€”you're already at peak MILD readiness in this aspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  5. Connect dream signs. Once you've imagined yourself becoming lucid in the dream using your chosen dream sign, continue the narrative by imagining what else you'll do next and add more dream signs to it for extra strengthening! For example, let's say you go to your childhood home frequently in your dreams and use that location as a dream sign for MILD, but you also often dream about your dog. Now, imagine that your dog is at the childhood home that you're using as a dream sign. This creates a connection between dream signs. Consistency is important when developing these mental connections. The more you consistently connect the idea of your childhood home to encountering your dog in your mind as you do MILD, the more they will connect in your dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  6 (BONUS). Every time you do MILD, take a second to assess whether you are currently in a dream. Who knows, you could be dreaming right now! Combining MILD with present-moment awareness is a powerful way to promote frequent lucid dreams (this is a way of seemlesly integrating different types of techniques). </h3>
