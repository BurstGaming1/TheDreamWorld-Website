<h3 style="color: gold;"> Three timing-based factors that can increase the effectiveness of MILD.

<h3 style="color: azure; font: italic;"> MILD can be done anytime to great effect. Here's some tips on how to get the most out of MILD depending on the time you use it:
<br>
<br>
  1. With WBTB 4-6 hours into sleep. Either with a natural awaking or an alarm, wake yourself up at 4-6 hours into sleep and then go back to sleep doing MILD. This is shown to be an effective time to do MILD.
  <br>
  2. Before sleep onset. Doing MILD during WBTB or even at the beginning of the night is effective because it's common to dream about the things you think most about moments before falling asleep.
  <br>
  3. Duration of MILD. You can do MILD for just a few minutes and get good results. Spending extra time on MILD can increase the effectiveness of it, too (as long as you aren't doing it so much that it feels like a chore and becomes mindless). Mindfully repeating the MILD process a few times can do wonders to strengthen MILD.
  <br>
  4. Frequency. Doing MILD more frequently (even if just for a couple minutes each time) can greatly increase the effectiveness. This is especially helpful if you intend to do MILD during the daytime, as you can do it a few times a day at different intervals to strengthen it. It doesn't matter when you do MILD (feel free to set reminders on your phone or just do it whenever) because MILD is a future intention-setting technique (and not one of the present-moment practices like reality checks).
  <br>
  <br>
  All in all, it's recommended you do MILD either at the beginning of the night, during the day, or with WBTB. Then, either do it for more than a few minutes each time, or do it more frequently to offset shorter times.
