<h3 style="color: azure; font: italic;"> Dreams are most fresh in your memory in the first few minutes (even seconds) upon waking up. Timing of your dream recall is your magic trick to remembering dreams, especially if you currently don't recall having dreams on a regular basis. By training yourself to attempt remembering dreams 100% of the time when you first wake up as a habit, you also increase your recall through habit and intent. You train your mind to start paying attention to dreams and building intent towards recall in the future every time you try. Intent to remember itself is very powerful, and when intent is backed by consistent action, it's strengthened.
