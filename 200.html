<h3 style="color: azure; font: italic;"> 1. Makes your dreams more vivid and detailed. Most beginner dreamers report significant improvements to vividness of dreams after improving their dream recall. It turns out that our dreams are naturally highly vivid and detailed by default, but if we can't remember those details, we may remember the dream as being blurry or non-vivid.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Increases your sense of presence in the moment during dreams, which cultivates both vividness and awareness. Instead of feeling like a memory, you will start to experience dreams as real time occurrence just like you experience waking life during the day. This increases your odds of lucid dreaming automatically (without techniques) through heightened present-moment awareness.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Increases your chances of becoming lucid due to a change in how you view dreams in general. As you remember your dreams more clearly and experience them in the present moment, they will start to feel just as real as your waking life. Natural lucid dreaming will become more likely as a result. Even though recall isn't considered a lucid dreaming induction method, it primes you for naturally occurring lucid dreams.
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Allows you to notice dream signs that can be used for MILD (a powerful lucid dreaming technique). If you're working with MILD, recall can help you apply this particular lucid dreaming technique with greater effectiveness.
    <br>
    <br>
    5. Allows you to improve dream control of both lucid and non-lucid dreams through better understanding the way your dreams work, rewriting dreams, and incubating what you want to happen in future dreams. Being able to remember more dreams gives you the power to alter them. </h3>
