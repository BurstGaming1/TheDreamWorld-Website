<h3 style="color: gold;">What Is Lucid Dreaming?</h3>
</center>

<h3 style="color: azure; font: italic;"> Lucid dreaming means you are aware that you're dreaming while your physical body sleeps. Lucidity does not define your vividness or control over dreams, but allows you to be more present and in control of your dreams. Being aware that you're dreaming allows you to make conscious decisions about your dreams, which you wouldn't otherwise know to make in dreams that you mistake for your waking reality.
<br>
<br>
    By being present and lucid (aware) in your dreams, your dreams can take on a life of their own, feeling just as vivid and realistic as your waking life. By using conscious dream control, you can change settings, scenarios, characters, plots, and all other aspects of your dream life! You can teleport, fly, turn into a dragon, meet fictional characters, and anything else you choose.
    <br>
    <br>
    Your dreams can be one-off adventures each night, or you can choose to connect your dreams so that each dream continues from the last. Just like how you wake up every morning to continue your day, dreams can also be continued each night.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some dreamers are naturally gifted with lucidity while others can train themselves to be lucid just like a natural. Training for non-naturals can result in effortless nightly lucid dreams. This website is tailored towards training lucid dreaming not just as a one-time occurance, but as a permanent lifelong and automatic ability. It may also be useful to natural lucid dreamers looking to increase frequency or dream control.
