<h3 style="color: azure; font: italic;"> Intention can be a powerful tool for recall. Before going to sleep, tell yourself that you'll remember your dreams upon waking. Imagine remembering your dreams the previous night, and what it may be like to remember them the following night. Walk yourself through the process of remembering dreams in your mind, and remind yourself that you'll remember to go through your dreams immediately upon waking up. Hype yourself up with the possibility that you might have a really good dream to recall. Setting intention to remember your dreams can be done in the same way you set intention to get up early in the morning or do something like a household chore during the day.

    Remember, following through on your intentions with actions is what strengthens the intent. So make sure to practicing remembering dreams when you wake up, in addition to setting your intention to do so.
