<h3 style="color: azure; font: italic;"> If you don't currently have any dreams to remember, make sure that you are not taking any substances that can hinder or prevent dreaming (including alcohol, cannabis, and certain medications such as sleeping pills, which are known to suppress dreams and/or recall).
<br>
<br>
    If you are not taking any substances that suppress dreaming or recall, lack of dreams can be fixed with dream recall practice. It may take a week or more of consistent practice to start resolving the issue, so keep up the practice and you'll get there!
    <br>
    <br>
    Truly not having dreams at all (rather than just poor recall) is a serious health concern. <h2 style="color: red;"> talk to your doctor if you suspect that you are truly not having any dreams.
